Hi! I am Nikita Koval and you are on my personal website.
I am a researcher in the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) team at JetBrains and
lead a [Concurrent Computing lab](https://research.jetbrains.org/groups/concurrent_computing/)
at JetBrains Research, working on a PhD in the field of concurrency at the same time.
My primary research interests are concurrent data structures and algorithms, their verification, and practically applicable code analysis.
Here you can find all the recent information about me and my projects.

<b>News:</b>
<ul>
<li> <b><i>2022-05-10:</i></b> <a href="https://hydraconf.com/">Hydra'22</a> will take place online this year, and I am excited to help the conference as a PC member.
     Additionally to that, I will give a short series on "Introduction to Concurrent Programming" ðŸŽ‰
</li>
<li> <b><i>2021-12-02:</i></b> Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00657">paper</a> on practical priority schedulers is accepted at PPoPP!
     In short, we took simple and scalable but inefficient Multi-Queue design, applied a bunch of
     industrial techniques with various tricks, and outperformed the state-of-the-art ðŸ’ª
</li>
<li> <b><i>2021-11-23:</i></b> We published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12682">pre-print</a> of our paper on <i>CancellableQueueSynchronizer</i>, an abstraction
     for building efficient fair and abortable synchronization primitives such as mutexes, semaphores, barriers, count-down-latches, and blocking pools.
</li>
<li> <b><i>2021-05-19:</i></b> Our work with Alexander Fedorov (JetBrains Research) and Dan Alistarh (IST Austria)
     on the first truly concurrent algorithm for the dynamic connectivity problem has been accepted at SPAA!
     The pre-print is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08098">arXiv</a>.
</li>
<li> <b><i>2021-02-24:</i></b> Some time ago, we finally released bounded model checking in <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-lincheck/">Lincheck</a> --
     a framework for testing concurrency on JVM. See a <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/02/how-we-test-concurrent-primitives-in-kotlin-coroutines/">blog post</a>
     for a short overview of how it and about Lincheck in general!

<b>I am also incredibly happy to have a chance to work with the following people who have significantly influenced my career:</b>
<ul>
<li> Yury Kudryashov (Technical lead @ Devexperts).
     Yury offered me the first job and showed me how good development processes and teamwork should be organized, which helps me a lot so far.
</li>
<li> Dmitry Tsitelov (Head of dxLab @ Devexperts).
     Dmitry influenced me to move my attention from the industry to academia, which changed my career entirely.
     He supported me a lot when I worked at Devexperts and helped to start my research career.
