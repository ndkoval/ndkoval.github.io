Hi! I am Nikita Koval and you are on my personal website.
I work as a researcher in the Kotlin team at JetBrains and getting PhD in the field of concurrency.
My primary research interests are concurrent data structures and algorithms, their verification, and practically applicable code analysis approaches.
Here you can find all the recent information about me and my projects.
Do not hesitate to drop me a line if you have an interesting topic to discuss.
</p>

     In short, we took simple and scalable but inefficient Multi-Queue design, applied a bunch of
     industrial techniques with various tricks, and outperformed the state-of-the-art ðŸ’ª

<b>I am also incredibly happy to had a chance to work with the following people who significantly influenced my career:</b>
