I am a research engineer at dxLab research group at Devexperts and in the second year of a masterâ€™s degree program in computer sciences at ITMO University, where I have been also teaching a course on concurrency programming. I am mainly interested in concurrent algorithms, their verification and practical applicable code analysis approaches. See my [projects](/projects), [publications](/publications) and [given talks](/talks) on this site.
