I am a research in Kotlin team at JetBrains and going to be a PhD student at IST Austria from the Fall. I got both bachelor and master degrees at ITMO University, where I have been also teaching a course on concurrency programming. I am mainly interested in concurrent algorithms, their verification, and practical applicable code analysis approaches. See my [projects](/projects), [publications](/publications) and [given talks](/talks) on this site.
