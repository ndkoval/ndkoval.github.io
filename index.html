Hi! I am Nikita Koval and you are on my personal website.
I am a researcher in the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> team at JetBrains and
lead a <a href="https://research.jetbrains.org/groups/concurrent_computing/">Concurrent Computing lab</a>
at JetBrains Research, working on a PhD in the field of concurrency at the same time.
My primary research interests are concurrent data structures and algorithms, their verification, and practically applicable code analysis.
Here you can find all the recent information about me and my projects.

<br/>
<br/>

I am passionate about outdoor activities, such as cycling,
skiing, or hiking when not working. Yet, the true love is
sailing on small sports boats — that's me on a laser on the right ⛵

<br/>
<br/>

Do not hesitate to drop me a line if we have an interesting topic to discuss!
