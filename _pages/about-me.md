I am a researcher in the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) team at JetBrains and lead a [Concurrent Computing lab](https://research.jetbrains.org/groups/concurrent_computing/) at JetBrains Research, working on a PhD in the field of concurrency at the same time. I got both bachelor's and master's degrees at ITMO University in St. Petersburg, where I have also been teaching a course on Concurrent Programming for over five years. My primary research interests are concurrent data structures and algorithms, their verification, and practically applicable code analysis. See my [projects](/projects), [publications](/publications), and [given talks](/talks) on this website. I am also extremely happy to have been supervised by [Dan Alistarh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/) from IST Austria and [Roman Elizarov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/relizarov) from JetBrains.
